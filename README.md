## Methods to work with files:

- file_get_contents() - reads the entire contents of a file into a string. It's a quick and simple way to get the contents of a file.

- file_put_contents() - writes a string to a file. It creates the file if it doesn't exist, or overwrites the existing file.

- fopen() - opens a file or URL and returns a resource that can be used to read from or write to the file. It's often used with other functions such as fgets() and fwrite() to read or write specific lines of the file.

- fclose() - closes an open file pointer.

- fgets() - reads a line from an open file pointer.

- fwrite() - writes a string to an open file pointer.

## Serialization

Serialization in PHP is a process of converting a PHP object or data structure into a string format that can be stored or transmitted, and then converting it back to its original form later.
