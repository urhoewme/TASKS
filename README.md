# TASK 9

## Inheritance:

Allows to adopt methods and parameters of classes
There are such concepts as:

- Parent class
- Child class

## Interfaces:

An interface is a contract to execute a method. It defines which methods the class should implement, no matter how they are implemented

## Abstract classes:

An abstract class is considered such if it has at least one abstract method
Objects cannot be created on the basis of such a class
The abstract class can only be inherited

## Differences between abstract classes and interfaces

- An interface supports multiple inheritance, unlike the abstract class
- The interface only contains declaration of methods, not their implementation
- All access modifiers in the interface are public
- Methods cannot be static in the interface
