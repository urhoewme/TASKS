# TASK 4

## functions to delete array elements:

- unset(): removes an element from the array by its key
- array_splice(): removes elements from the array and returns an array containing the deleted elements
- array_pop(): removes and returns the last element of the array
- array_shift(): removes and returns the first element of the array

## to minimize memory costs are better suited to:

- unset()
- array_filter()

### they don't create a new array and don't use additional memory to store deleted items
