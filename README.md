# TASK 1
## Difference between if-elseif-else, switch-case, ternary operator
+ if - the code block will be executed if the condition is true. otherwise the code will not be executed.
+ switch - it's a construction that allows you to compare an expression with several variants and execute the corresponding block of code for the first corresponding variant
+ Тернарный оператор - is a shorthand way of writing an if construction that allows you to choose between two values depending on the result of the expression. It has the following syntax: condition ? value1 : value2.
## Nullish coalescing operator (??)
is an operator that returns the left operand unless it is null or undefined, otherwise it returns the right operand. It allows you to check if a value exists and does not perform a boolean type conversion.

# What's better ?
In my opinion, according to the conditions set in the current task, it is best to use switch-case construction, since we are dealing with multiple choices
If the number of choices were not so big, the ternary operator
